      "<ListItem> [CLS] why does heathcliff revenge on hindley? hindley takes revenge on heathcliff for taking his place at wuthering heights by denying him an education, and in the process separates heathcliff and catherine. heathcliff then takes revenge upon hindley by, first, dispossessing hindley of wuthering heights and by denying an education to hareton, hindley ’ s son. who did heathcliff want revenge on? throughout wuthering heights two distinct yet related obsessions drive heathcliff ’ s character : his desire for catherine ’ s love and his need for revenge. catherine, the object of his obsession, becomes the essence of his life, yet, in a sense, he ends up murdering his love. how does heathcliff feel about hindley? hindley ’ s dislike of heathcliff stems from the fact that his father adopted the orphan heathcliff and he felt that he had stolen his father ’ s affection. heathcliff ’ s dislike of hindley originates from the ill treatment that he receives from hindley, almost from the moment that he enters the household. does heathcliff destroy hindley or does hindley destroy himself? soon after catherine ’ s death, hindley dies too. the details are not exactly revealed, but heathcliff claims hindley “ spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately. ” suicide is more probable than murder because heathcliff had the chance to kill hindley before but never did so. why does heathcliff want revenge in wuthering heights? from the above analysis, we can see that there are some obvious reasons fo heathcliff ’ s revenge in the novel. his low status in the family, hindley ’ s cruelty to him, the lintons ’ lack of sympathy, and more importantly, catherine ’ s change of love to him, all these make him to take revenge on this ruthless world. how is heathcliff succeeding in his revenge in wuthering heights? heathcliff succeeds in avenging himself against hindley, who degraded him so much that catherine could not think of marrying him. hindley, an alcoholic, is addicted to gambling by the time heathcliff returns as a gentleman after three years ’ absence. how does heathcliff treats hindley? after mr. earnshaw dies, his resentful son hindley abuses heathcliff and treats him as a servant. how does hindley punish heathcliff when he returns? how does hindley punish heathcliff when he returns? he kicks him out </ListItem>\n",
      "<ListItem> ##cliff is highly upset with the new catherine. as they grow up, catherine finds herself in love with edgar, but more in love with heathcliff. she chooses to marry edgar, forever wounding the terrible - natured heathcliff. heathcliff eventually leaves for three years, and hindley becomes a drunk who is very abusive to his son. when heathcliff returns, he marries isabella linton, even though edgar disapproves. soon after this, catherine gives birth to a daughter, catherine, and dies. isabella is treated horribly by heathcliff and eventually runs off to london, where she gives birth to their son, linton. isabella dies after about twelve years. linton is brought back to wuthering heights where heathcliff and hareton live. catherine still lives in thrushcross grange with nelly and edgar, who is dying. catherine learns of her cousins, hareton and linton, and heathcliff forces catherine to marry linton. soon after they marry, edgar dies. linton was also very sick and he dies relatively quickly after edgar does. both of their deaths gives heathcliff full control of thrushcross grange and wuthering heights. this is the end of the flashback that nelly was telling lockwood. lockwood decides not to stay at thrushcross grange any longer and goes to tell heathcliff of this. lockwood eventually leaves and heathcliff starts to go nuts. he can see the resemblence of catherine in the young catherine, as well as in hareton. he eventually dies. lockwood learns of this when he returns to talk to nelly after a few months. he also learns that catherine and hareton are to be married soon. 1 ) catherine ( the mother ) is torn between the love of two guys, heathcliff and edgar. she eventually marries edgar even though she loves heathcliff more because her brother, hindley, detests heathcliff and has degraded him. have you ever had to make a tough decision or been influenced into something due to the thoughts of others? if so, why would you let them persuade you? 2 ) heathcliff leaves for three years once catherine marries edgar. when he returns, he is a wealthy \" gentleman. \" he becomes this way because of his love for catherine. have you ever done something out of love for someone, even if it pains you at first?
